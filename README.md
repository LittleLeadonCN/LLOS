LLOS is a lightweight non real time resource management system that can run on MCUs that support 64 bit variables. It implements thread management in an event driven manner, with the aim of replacing bare metal programming. The system kernel provides simple thread management, inter task communication, soft timers, RTC, dynamic memory management, and device driver framework. In addition, up to now, it has been equipped with easy-to-use and powerful button drivers, LED/GPIO driver modules, and SSD1306 screen driver modules. Other modules are still under development.
